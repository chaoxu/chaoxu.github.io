Yes! I am excited about all the combinatorial goodness!
Certainly I want to learn about combinatorics of set systems, extremal combinatorics, combinatorial optimization, set theory and mathematical logic.

I will also take complex analysis and measure theory so I can get over with my math major requirements. Those are the only course I will transfer.

People who apply there are people who actually interested in math, not people who want to get over with the degree to be a high school teacher. I expect to meet a lot of new math friends.

If I'm in a private college, I would be happy with the tuition. However, I'm in a state college. Oh well.
