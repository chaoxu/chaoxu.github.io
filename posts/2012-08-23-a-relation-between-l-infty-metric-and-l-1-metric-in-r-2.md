While solving the [Meeting Point](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/meeting-point) problem from interviewstreet, I have stumbled upon a relation between $L_\infty$ metric and $L_1$ metric in $\R^2$.

{Theorem}
    Let $x=(x_1,x_2)$, consider the map $f:\R^2\to \R^2$,
    \[
    f(x) = (x_1-x_2,x_1+x_2)
    \]
    then
    \[
    d_\infty(x,y) = \frac{d_1(f(x),f(y))}{2}
    \]

{Proof}
    1. Notice we only need to prove $\|x\|_\infty = \frac{ \|f(x)\|_1}{2}$ as the metric is the standard metric generated by the norm.
    2. Note the following relation $\max(|a|,|b|) = \frac{ |a+b| + |a-b|}{2}$.
    3. Combine the two above and we get the result.
