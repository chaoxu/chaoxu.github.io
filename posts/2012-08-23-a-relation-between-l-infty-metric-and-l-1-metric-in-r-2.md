While solving the [Meeting Point](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/meeting-point) problem from hackerrank, I have stumbled upon a relation between $L_\infty$ metric and $L_1$ metric in $\R^2$.

::: Theorem
  Let $x=(x_1,x_2)$, consider the map $f:\R^2\to \R^2$,
  \[
  f(x) = (x_1-x_2,x_1+x_2)
  \]
  then
  \[
  d_\infty(x,y) = \frac{d_1(f(x),f(y))}{2}
  \]
:::
::: Proof

  1. Notice we only need to prove $\|x\|_\infty = \frac{ \|f(x)\|_1}{2}$ as the metric is the standard metric generated by the norm.
  2. Note the following relation $\max(|a|,|b|) = \frac{ |a+b| + |a-b|}{2}$.
  3. Combine the two above and we get the result.
