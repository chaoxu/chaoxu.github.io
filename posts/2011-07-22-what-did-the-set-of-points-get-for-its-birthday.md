Q: What did the set of points get for its birthday?

A: A convex 헐! 

I come up with the joke with the help of [Eun Hye Lee](http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~elee211/).
Hopefully computational geometers who also know Korean can appreciate that.

(헐 sounds like "hull". People say "헐" when they a mildly surprised. A common algorithm for computing convex hulls is the [gift wrapping algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm).)

Bonus: 

Q: What is French computational geometers' favorite food? 

A: An ε-filet.
