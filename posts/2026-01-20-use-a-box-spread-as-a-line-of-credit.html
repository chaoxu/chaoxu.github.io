        <br />
<div>
<p>In an idealized world, you could borrow at the Effective Federal
Funds Rate (EFFR) and also earn roughly the same rate on cash deposits.
For simplicity, assume the relevant short rate is fixed for a month.
Let’s say it turns out to be 10% <em>per month</em>. Assume the stock
will rise by 20% that month.</p>
<p>In reality, lenders (and banks taking deposits) need to earn a
spread, so borrowing and deposit rates won’t match. But for the sake of
argument, assume both are close to EFFR.</p>
<p>Suppose that over the next month, the maximum cumulative cash
shortfall I might face is $100. Then I can keep $100 in the bank as a
buffer. Maybe I earn $20, spend $50, then spend $70, and then my next
paycheck of $100 arrives. My bank balance never goes negative, and
perhaps my daily average balance is $50. Roughly speaking, I earn
interest on $50 to be $5.</p>
<p>Now suppose instead I start with only $50 in the bank and invest the
other $50 elsewhere (say, in stocks). If I run short of cash, I can
borrow quickly, transfer funds into my checking account, and later repay
the loan. This is essentially what a line of credit (LOC) does: you draw
when needed and pay interest only on the outstanding balance.</p>
<p>Another way to view it is a checking account that’s allowed to go
negative (an overdraft line), where negative balances incur
interest.</p>
<p>If you can borrow at the same rate you can earn on cash, then holding
$50 less cash and borrowing $50 when needed does not create free profit.
In frictionless form, you’re mostly exchanging:</p>
<ul>
<li>less interest earned on cash (because you keep less cash),</li>
<li>for interest paid on borrowing (when you’re short).</li>
</ul>
<p>Those effects can be close to offsetting only when the borrowing and
lending rates are the same and the timing matches. But in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>borrowing rates are usually higher than deposit yields,</li>
<li>timing matters (you don’t borrow continuously; you borrow
intermittently),</li>
<li>there are transaction costs, bid/ask spreads, and operational
risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s left is not a clean cancellation; it’s “equity exposure
minus financing frictions.” But it seems, it should still amount almost
everything cancelling out in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>However, in the U.S., bank interest is generally ordinary income.
Meanwhile, interest you pay is not automatically deductible. This breaks
the symmetry, and needs to be further studied.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_spread">box spread</a>
is (economically) a synthetic loan created from options. When priced
efficiently, the implied financing rate tends to track a risk-free(-ish)
rate for that tenor, often close to EFFR. In that sense, a box spread
can approximate “borrow at a near-risk-free rate for a fixed term.”</p>
<p>Now, a box spread is a fixed-term, fixed-principal loan. It is not a
true revolving LOC, which is what we really want. You can’t “draw $x
today, repay tomorrow, redraw later” flexibility.</p>
<p>However, we can simulate it as a LOC. Just put unused borrowed cash
in a bank.</p>
<p>So consider I start with $100, and what happens in different
scenarios.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I borrow $100 and “return” it immediately. I gain $10 of interest,
and lose $10 from execute the box spread. The $100 I did not use was put
in stock. I now have $120 (with $20 unrealized gain), and incurs a $10
ordinary income and $10 capital loss.</li>
<li>I borrow $100 and used them all. I lose $10 from execute the box
spread. The $100 I did not use was put in stock. I now have $120 (with
$20 unrealized gains), and a $10 capital loss.</li>
<li>I $100 in the bank in the beginning, I get $110 in the end, with
tax-wise $10 ordinary income.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now this means if I do believe there is something with higher
performance than EFFR, I should always borrow for my cash needs.</p>
