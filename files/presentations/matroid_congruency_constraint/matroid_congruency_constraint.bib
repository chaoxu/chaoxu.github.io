    abstract = { Abstract The modular subset sum problem consists of deciding, given a modulus m, a multiset S of n integers in 0.m – 1, and a target integer t, whether there exists a subset of S with elements summing to t (mod m), and to report such a set if it exists. We give a simple O(m log m)-time with high probability (w.h.p.) algorithm for the modular subset sum problem. This builds on and improves on a previous O(m log7 m) w.h.p. algorithm from Axiotis, Backurs, Jin, Tzamos, and Wu (SODA 19). Our method utilizes the ADT of the dynamic strings structure of Gawrychowski et al. (SODA 18). However, as this structure is rather complicated we present a much simpler alternative which we call the Data Dependent Tree. As an application, we consider the computational version of a fundamental theorem in zero-sum Ramsey theory. The Erdős-Ginzburg-Ziv Theorem states that a multiset of 2n – 1 integers always contains a subset of cardinality exactly n whose values sum to a multiple of n. We give an algorithm for finding such a subset in time O(n log n) w.h.p. which improves on an O(n2) algorithm due to Del Lungo, Marini, and Mori (Disc. Math. 09). }

abstract = {Given n positive integers, the Modular Subset Sum problem asks if a subset adds up to a given target t modulo a given integer m. This is a natural generalization of the Subset Sum problem (where m = +∞) with ties to additive combinatorics and cryptography.Recently, in [Bri17, KX17], efficient algorithms have been developed for the non-modular case, running in near-linear pseudo-polynomial time. For the modular case, however, the best known algorithm by Koiliaris and Xu [KX17] runs in time \~{O}(m5/4).In this paper, we present an algorithm running in \~{O}(m) randomized time, which matches a recent conditional lower bound of [ABHS17] based on the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. Interestingly, in contrast to most previous results on Subset Sum, our algorithm does not use the Fast Fourier Transform. Instead, it is able to simulate the "textbook" Dynamic Programming algorithm much faster, using ideas from linear sketching. This is one of the first applications of sketching-based techniques to obtain fast algorithms for exact combinatorial problems in an offline setting.},

    abstract = { Abstract We revisit the Subset Sum problem over the finite cyclic group ℤm for some given integer m. A series of recent works has provided near-optimal algorithms for this problem under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. Koiliaris and Xu (SODA'17, TALG'19) gave a deterministic algorithm running in time , which was later improved to O(m log7 m) randomized time by Axiotis et al. (SODA'19). In this work, we present two simple algorithms for the Modular Subset Sum problem running in near-linear time in m, both efficiently implementing Bellman's iteration over ℤm. The first one is a randomized algorithm running in time O(m log2 m), that is based solely on rolling hash and an elementary data-structure for prefix sums; to illustrate its simplicity we provide a short and efficient implementation of the algorithm in Python. Our second solution is a deterministic algorithm running in time ℤ(m polylog m), that uses dynamic data structures for string manipulation. We further show that the techniques developed in this work can also lead to simple algorithms for the All Pairs Non-Decreasing Paths Problem (APNP) on undirected graphs, matching the near-optimal running time of provided in the recent work of Duan et al. (ICALP'19). }

abstract = {Given a directed graph as input, we show how to efficiently find a shortest (directed, simple) cycle on an even number of vertices. As far as we know, no polynomial-time algorithm was previously known for this problem. In fact, finding any even cycle in a directed graph in polynomial time was open for more than two decades until Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas (Ann. of Math. (2) 1999) and, independently, McCuaig (Electron. J. Combin. 2004; announced jointly at STOC 1997) gave an efficiently testable structural characterisation of even-cycle-free directed graphs. Methodologically, our algorithm relies on the standard framework of algebraic fingerprinting and randomized polynomial identity testing over a finite field, and in fact relies on a generating polynomial implicit in a paper of Vazirani and Yannakakis (Discrete Appl. Math. 1989) that enumerates weighted cycle covers by the parity of their number of cycles as a difference of a permanent and a determinant polynomial. The need to work with the permanent—known to be #P-hard apart from a very restricted choice of coefficient rings (Valiant, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 1979)—is where our main technical contribution occurs. We design a family of finite commutative rings of characteristic 4 that simultaneously (i) give a nondegenerate representation for the generating polynomial identity via the permanent and the determinant, (ii) support efficient permanent computations by extension of Valiant’s techniques, and (iii) enable emulation of finite-field arithmetic in characteristic 2. Here our work is foreshadowed by that of Bj\"{o}rklund and Husfeldt (SIAM J. Comput. 2019), who used a considerably less efficient commutative ring design—in particular, one lacking finite-field emulation—to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for the shortest two disjoint paths problem in undirected graphs. Building on work of Gilbert and Tarjan (Numer. Math. 1978) as well as Alon and Yuster (J. ACM 2013), we also show how ideas from the nested dissection technique for solving linear equation systems—introduced by George (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 1973) for symmetric positive definite real matrices—leads to faster algorithm designs in our present finite-ring randomized context when we have control on the separator structure of the input graph; for example, this happens when the input has bounded genus.},
