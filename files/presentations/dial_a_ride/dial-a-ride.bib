abstract = {Arising from structural graph theory, treewidth has become a focus of study in fixed-parameter tractable algorithms. Many NP-hard problems are known to be solvable in O(n · 2O(τ)) time, where τ is the treewidth of the input graph. Analogously, many problems in P should be solvable in O(n · τO(1)) time; however, due to the lack of appropriate tools, only a few such results are currently known. In our paper, we show this holds for linear programs: Given a linear program of the form minAx=b,ℓ ≤ x≤ u c⊤ x whose dual graph GA has treewidth τ, and a corresponding width-τ tree decomposition, we show how to solve it in time O(n&nbsp;·&nbsp;τ2&nbsp;log(1/ε)), where n is the number of variables and ε is the relative accuracy. When a tree decomposition is not given, we use existing techniques in vertex separators to obtain algorithms with O(n · τ4 log(1/ε)) and O(n · τ2 log(1/ε) + n1.5) run-times. Besides being the first of its kind, our algorithm has run-time nearly matching the fastest run-time for solving the sub-problem Ax=b (under the assumption that no fast matrix multiplication is used). We obtain these results by combining recent techniques in interior-point methods (IPMs), sketching, and a novel representation of the solution under a multiscale basis similar to the wavelet basis. This representation further yields the first IPM with o(rank(A)) time per iteration when the treewidth is small.},

  abstract = {We give efficient solutions to transportation problems motivated by the following robotics problem. A robot arm has the task of rearranging m objects between n stations in the plane. Each object is initially at one of these n stations and needs to be moved to another station. The robot arm consists of a single link that rotates about a fixed pivot. The link can extend in and out (like a telescope) so that its length is a variable. At the end of this "telescoping" link lies a gripper that is capable of grasping any one of the m given objects (the gripper cannot be holding more than one object at the same time). The robot arm must transport each of the m objects to its destination and come back to where it started. Since the problem of scheduling the motion of the gripper so as to minimize the total distance traveled is NP-hard, we focus on the problem of minimizing only the total angular motion (rotation of the link about the pivot), or only the telescoping motion. We give algorithms for two different modes of operation: (i) No-drops. No object can be dropped before its destination is reached. (ii) With-drops. Any object can be dropped at any number of intermediate points. Our algorithm for case (i) runs in O(m+ n log n) time for angular motion and in O(m+ na(n)) time for telescoping motion. Our algorithm for case (ii) runs in O(m+n) time for angular motion and with the same time bound for telescoping motion. The most interesting problem turns out to be that of minimizing angular motion for the with-drops mode of operation.},

The best previously available algorithm for this problem was an O(n log’n) algorithm for the two-dimensional case. A simple application of the nonlinear case is an O(n) algorithm for finding the point at which a ‘pursuer’ minimizes its distance from the furthest amongst n ‘targets’, when the trajectories involved are straight lines in Rd.},

abstract = {Dial-a-ride problems deal with on demand transportation. Today, this type of shared transport is used for elderly and disabled people for short distances. People provide a request for transport from an origin to a destination, both specific for a particular demand. Time constraints deal with maximum user ride time, time windows, maximum route duration limits and precedence. In this paper we try to solve these dial-a-ride problems, including the possibility of one transshipment from a dynamic transfer point by request. We propose an algorithm based on insertion techniques and constraints propagation.}

abstract = {In this paper, an online regret based dial-a-ride (OR-DARP) algorithm is introduced and its performance evaluated on an actual demand responsive transit (DRT) system. The innovative part of the algorithm is the design of the optimization engine. A signal communication scheme between the trip dispatcher and the algorithm is used to improve utilization of the available idle time that can then be devoted to the optimization engine. The basic concept is as follows: a. Every trip request is treated as an emergency request demanding an immediate answer, b. The optimization engine runs continuously, thereby consuming every idle time fragment unless interrupted by a new trip request. The trip data are real, and they are sourced from a DRT system operating at a municipality in northern Greece where a static dial-a-ride algorithm was used as the optimization engine. Given the fact that these trips data provide all trip details plus the show-up time (the most important feature for our study), these data are the ideal basis for an “a posteriori” evaluation of the proposed online approach. Another contribution of this paper is the identification of the critical parameters in the trade-off between benefits gained from continuing to optimize an online system versus the losses of non-served demands. This important issue when applying online algorithms has not been studied extensively in the literature so far (to the best of our knowledge).}

A mixed-strategy heuristic with a bound of 9/5 is presented for the stacker-crane problem (a modified traveling salesman problem). A tour-splitting heuristic is given for k-person variants of the traveling salesman problem, the Chinese postman problem, and the stacker-crane problem, for which a minimax solution is sought.

  abstract = {We study a variety of multi-vehicle generalizations of the Stacker Crane Problem (SCP). The input consists of a mixed graph \$\$G=(V,E,A)\$\$with vertex set V, edge set E and arc set A, and a nonnegative integer cost function c on \$\$E {\textbackslash}cup A\$\$. We consider the following three problems: (1) k-depot SCP (k-DSCP). There is a depot set \$\$D{\textbackslash}subseteq V\$\$containing k distinct depots. The goal is to determine a collection of k closed walks including all the arcs of A such that the total cost of the closed walks is minimized, where each closed walk corresponds to the route of one vehicle and has to start from a distinct depot and return to it. (2) k-SCP. There are no given depots, and each vehicle may start from any vertex and then go back to it. The objective is to find a collection of k closed walks including all the arcs of A such that the total cost of the closed walks is minimized. (3) k-depot Stacker Crane Path Problem (k-DSCPP). There is a depot set \$\$D{\textbackslash}subseteq V\$\$containing k distinct depots. The aim is to find k (open) walks including all the arcs of A such that the total cost of the walks is minimized, where each (open) walk has to start from a distinct depot but may end at any vertex. We present the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for all the above three problems. To be specific, we give 3-approximation algorithms for the k-DSCP, the k-SCP and the k-DSCPP. If the costs of the arcs are symmetric, i.e., for every arc there is a parallel edge of no greater cost, we develop better algorithms with approximation ratios \$\${\textbackslash}max {\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}frac\{9\}\{5\},2-{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2k+1\}{\textbackslash}\}\$\$, 2, 2, respectively.
