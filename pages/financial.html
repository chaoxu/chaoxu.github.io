        <h1 id="article-title">Financial Freedom Advices</h1>
        <p>This article are for US person who is</p>
<ul>
<li>Single, living and working as a salaried employee, and current tax
bracket higher than retirement tax bracket.</li>
<li>No need to liquidate a large percent of investment in a short time
range (for example, downpayment for a house in 5 years).</li>
<li>You want to do <em>passive investments</em>.</li>
<li>Not interested in beating the market, but match the market. This
means if the market goes down, money goes down, and that is fine.</li>
<li>Wants to reach financial freedom earlier in life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are just things I’ve learned throughout the years. In order to
reach financial freedom, which requires passive income to be more than
your yearly spend, you can change one of the two factors. Increase
income or decrease expense. Likely you get there faster by doing
both.</p>
<p>You might still want to work even if you reach financial freedom. But
at that point, you can decide what to work on. For example, I personally
have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs">golden
handcuffs</a>, where I don’t have freedom to just chose any job. I have
to chose a job that pays comparable to my current one.</p>
<h1 data-number="1" id="increase-income"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Increase Income</h1>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="asset-allocation"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Asset Allocation</h2>
<p>You have to figure out your risk tolerance. Unfortunately, all one
knows is having more risk means more reward, but exactly how much risk
you are getting for each action is unclear. In the end, diversify avoids
the most risk. I personally recommends Personal Capital <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> for
tracking the status of all your assets.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.1" id="liquid-cash"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Liquid cash</h3>
<p>Having a good checking account for <em>small</em> amount of cash.
This allows one to handle lot of simple bill related stuff. Make sure it
is sufficient to cover very short term living expenses. Get a checking
account which satisfies most of your needs <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
You can shop around to see which one benefits you the most. Credit
unions might offer more benefits over large banks. <a
href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/bank-accounts/">Check doctor of
credits to find ones with good rates and offers</a>.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.2" id="emergency-fund"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Emergency Fund</h3>
<p>Always have around <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03148em;">k</span></span></span></span> months living
expense in the emergency fund. The emergency fund should exists in a
high yield checking/savings account <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> insured by FDIC or NCUA.
For most people <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03148em;">k</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">3</span></span></span></span> is sufficient. You
might want larger <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03148em;">k</span></span></span></span> to avoid risks. For
example, you find that it is hard to find a job in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">3</span></span></span></span> months. However, at that point, you could
liquidate some of the other portfolios.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.3" id="investments"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Investments</h3>
<p>When I say portfolio, I excludes all liquid cash and emergency funds
(since they should not be a huge part of your total asset). Note that
return = cash + beta + alpha. You want to invest passively, then you can
only hope to capture beta. I recommend <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118921283/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chaoxu-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1118921283&amp;linkId=2ae64a2b8e5c0c4a5742210aff4a2494">The
Bogleheads’ Guide to Investing</a>. It is the best book out of the bunch
I have read.</p>
<h4 data-number="1.1.3.1" id="diversification-over-asset-class"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.3.1</span> Diversification over asset
class</h4>
<p>Diverse portfolio. If you truly don’t care, not even thinking about
setting up a simple allocations, then just use Wealthfront <a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> or <a
href="https://www.betterment.com/">betterment</a>. They do automatic
investment techniques knowing your risk.</p>
<p>However if you trust yourself and want to save that little fees they
charge. The easiest is a 3 fund portfolio. Total US stock (or S&amp;P
500), Total international stock and Total US bond. Any low fee fund is
sufficient. For example, a 80% stock, 20% bond portfolio using vanguard
ETFs:</p>
<ul>
<li>60% S&amp;P 500 (VOO)<br />
</li>
<li>20% International Stock (VXUS)</li>
<li>20% US Bonds (BND)</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of market fluctuation, the relative proportions change after
a while. Therefore one have to do some rebalancing. If you set the
relative fractions correctly, but doesn’t want to do manual rebalancing,
then you can set the percentage and use M1 Finance<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> to
automatically rebalancing.</p>
<p>If you are into manually balancing, for the above portfolio, you can
use Vanguard. You can also use the mutual funds version instead of the
ETF version.</p>
<p>One can also rebalance using <a
href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-parity.asp">risk
parity</a>. I do not know any product where you pick your funds and it
does automated risk parity rebalancing. This you have to do
yourself.</p>
<h4 data-number="1.1.3.2" id="diversification-over-time"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.3.2</span> Diversification over
time</h4>
<p>Invest part of the salary whenever you obtain salary. Instead of
buying in a lot at the same time. This allows you to diversify
overtime.</p>
<p>In order to diversify over time, you should have equal allocation
each year. But your current salary might be <em>much smaller</em> than
how much contribution you have in 10 years. Therefore you should use
leverage if possible. One will quickly see the only leverage an average
salaried employee is real estate loans, therefore it make sense to spend
on real estate.</p>
<p>Sometimes you obtain a large amount of money at one time, like
bonuses. You can still try to invest it overtime, say in range of a
year. If you know the amount of bonuses you will obtain over time, you
can also invest a bit more of your each salary. However it might cause
cash flow issues if your bonus goes below your expectation.</p>
<h4 data-number="1.1.3.3" id="company-stocks"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.3.3</span> Company Stocks</h4>
<p>For stock options, unless you have strong belief that this stock is
much better than your other investments. It should be sold on the day
you obtain it. Don’t give into <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">the endowment
effect</a>. However, if you do have lot of trust in your company, you
should not sell all the stocks. Since if you are working at that
company, you probably can’t buy stock due to trading windows.</p>
<h4 data-number="1.1.3.4" id="experimental-investments"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.3.4</span> Experimental
investments</h4>
<p>You might see a lot of investment ideas floating around. If you are
interested in them, first try <a
href="https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/">Portfolio Visualizer</a> to
visualize and backtest. Try different parameters, and understand the
theory behind the portfolio. It might let you retire a few years early.
It is definitely fine to invest small incremental amounts.</p>
<h5 data-number="1.1.3.4.1" id="leveraged-etf"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.3.4.1</span> Leveraged ETF</h5>
<p>There is something called leveraged ETF.

<p>Can we just multiply it’s return by <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">3</span></span></span></span> using leveraged ETFs?</p>
<p>The answer is no. It is definitely true for a single day. But not
true in the long term. Note a drop of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span></span></span></span>
fraction, then it needs to gain a fraction of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.0987em;vertical-align:-0.4033em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mopen nulldelimiter"></span><span class="mfrac"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.6954em;"><span style="top:-2.655em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span><span class="mbin mtight">−</span><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">x</span></span></span></span><span style="top:-3.23em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="frac-line" style="border-bottom-width:0.04em;"></span></span><span style="top:-3.394em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">x</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.4033em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose nulldelimiter"></span></span></span></span></span> to obtain the original return.
Hence one can see that even if VOO had return of 0, UPRO can have
negative returns. In the end volatility is what dominates. To understand
more, read <a
href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Inverse_and_leveraged_ETFs">inverse
and leveraged ETFs</a>.</p>
<p>However, there are claims that one can <a
href="https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=272007">mix
UPRO and TMF</a> to obtain amazing results. One could definitely
experiment with them. In fact I also experimented with it.</p>
<h4 data-number="1.1.3.5" id="brokers"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.3.5</span> Brokers</h4>
<p>Vanguard is a great broker because almost everything is free.
However, their support is only satisfactory. Note if you just use
Vanguard setup, you <em>cannot</em> use leveraged ETF, because they <a
href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/leveraged-inverse-etf-etn">explicitly
rejects them</a>. I personally use M1 Finance <a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> to
use the leveraged ETFs.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.4" id="my-setup"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> My setup</h3>
<p>My current setup</p>
<ul>
<li>An experimental account of around 15% of my money, implementing 60%
TMF and 40% UPRO</li>
<li>The remaining investments is almost all in VOO, and I’m trying to
rebalance it to have more bonds.</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal setup would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>70% VOO + TLT using monthly rebalancing through risk parity</li>
<li>20% UPRO + TMF using monthly rebalancing through risk parity</li>
<li>10% Foreign stock</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="1.1.5" id="real-estate"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.5</span> Real Estate</h3>
<p>Home loans are one of the cheapest loans, which gives you leverage.
You should prioritize that if it make sense. Especially there are huge
amount of tax advantages (if the house is expensive enough when itemized
deduction make sense). It makes even more sense if you live in the
house.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="asset-location-taxes"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Asset Location (Taxes)</h2>
<p>You can’t control market fluctuation, but you can (almost) control
taxes. Put your money in places that is tax efficient, so you can grow
better. To understand asset location, <a
href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement">read
the wiki here</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is most US stocks, the dividends are likely to be qualified
dividends, so it is quite tax efficient compared to bonds, which is
interest and taxed at the personal income rate. International stocks
requires you to pay international tax. It can be deducted if it is not
in a tax deferred or tax exempt account.</p>
<p>The idea is putting tax inefficient items into tax efficient accounts
and put tax efficient investments into taxable accounts.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb</p>
<ul>
<li>investments with high growth should be in tax exempt, then tax
deferred, until you run out of such things.</li>
<li>investments generating dividends put into tax efficient
accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note that <a
href="https://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/">HSA can
act as a retirement account</a> if you can tap into it.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.1"
id="maximization-of-tax-benefits-and-free-money"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Maximization of tax benefits
and free money</h3>
<p>For a simple example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salary: 160k</li>
<li>Bonus: 15% expected</li>
<li>Stock: vested value around 50k, each year</li>
<li>401k match: 100% match up to 6% of salary</li>
<li>Your company allows after tax 401k contribution which allows
rollovers (It’s not the same as Roth 401k!)</li>
<li>Lives in Seattle</li>
</ul>
<p>Do the following in sequence until you are out of money.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize 401k until employer match ($19000 + $9600=$28600)</li>
<li>Maximize HSA ($3500)</li>
<li>Maximize Commuter Benefits ($3180)</li>
<li>Maximize 401k (no change)</li>
<li>Maximize after tax 401k, IRA and <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/01/23/the-backdoor-roth-ira-advanced-version/#f2f12d355ada">roll
over to Roth IRA</a> ($56000 - $28600 + $6000 = $33000)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you go extreme, $62000 per year will be saved in retirement
account, where $33000 can be taken out in 5 years, the rest needs to
stay till retirement age. $3500 for medical expenses only, $3180 for
commuting only and <em>has to be spent</em> within the year. In total,
$19000+$3500+$3180=$25680 are from your own pre-tax money. $33000 are
after-tax money.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes">income tax
calculator</a> shows you prob have $150000 after tax. Hence you retain
around $117000 (this is assuming stock does not go up and down and you
liquidate it it as soon as it vests). Plenty of money for after-tax
investments.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="negotiate-and-compare"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Negotiate and compare</h2>
<p>There are many things can be negotiated. For example, your salary.
Your worth is how much the company will likely to pay you, always
negotiate salaries. Ask for a raise. It’s not just for yourself, your
family, your loved ones. It is for their good too. If they give your
salary below the market rate, you might be scooped by other companies.
In the end you leave, and both side loses. So try to negotiate for
better offers for every major financial transaction. This even includes
medical ones. Where you can go around ask for second opinions to save
yourself money. So always shop around.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="decrease-spending"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Decrease spending</h1>
<p>Avoid consumerism. Make sure to budget, and spend according to the
budget. Track your spendings. Look for good deals when you have to buy
something. Join loyalty programs if it is something you buy more than
once.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="credit-cards"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Credit Cards</h2>
<p>Never use debit cards when you can use credit cards. Make sure you
only use as much as you can pay back. Build good credits. Shop around
for good credit cards, say with <a
href="https://www.uscreditcardguide.com/en/">US credit card guide</a>.
Auto-pay all your cards and always pay full balance.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.1.1" id="my-setup-1"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> My setup</h3>
<p>My wallet consists of the following credit cards since I’m with
Chase</p>
<ul>
<li>The credit card where I need to meet spending requirement.</li>
<li>Chase Sapphire Reserve for dining and travel.</li>
<li>Chase Freedom Unlimited<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> for everything
else.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="cash-back-portal"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Cash Back Portal</h2>
<p>Most of the things you buy probably can use a cash back portal for
some of the money. Some of these portals are associated with your credit
card or your airline. There are many, like ebates(now rakuten), is one
of the most popular ones.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.1" id="my-setup-2"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> My setup</h3>
<ul>
<li>Whenever I’m about to buy something, I check <a
href="https://www.cashbackmonitor.com/">Cashback Monitor</a> to see if
there is any rewards. I had a good experience with Rakuten <a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.</li>
<li>I usually take the portal with my credit card or airline, because
they are most trust worthy, unless other sites have way too good a
rebate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="points-and-miles"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Points and miles</h2>
<p>There are many reward programs with lot of points and miles (will be
refereed commonly as points from now on). Here are some things to
remember</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Points devalues, therefore use them quickly</em>. Accumulating
lot of points doesn’t mean much once devaluation happen. Even ultimate
reward points that translate to statement credit devalues due to
inflation.</li>
<li><em>Value points rationally</em>. Exactly how much <em>you</em>
would accept to pay in cash is the value of the points. Those online
valuations for flights usually make sense because most of the ticket
prices are going to be high. However for hotels, it does not. Are you
really getting $200 value when you spend the points on a hotel? For
example, if there is a $100 hotel just around the corner and you would
pick that $100 hotel if you didn’t have the points (and say you can
spend $100 to buy the points). This implies your points worth less than
$100.</li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="2.4" id="travel"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Travel</h2>
<p>Credit card bonuses with points are usually sufficient if you do not
travel often. Try to take advantage of it. Get familiar with the few
common routes. Use <a
href="https://www.awardhacker.com/">AwardHacker</a> to find flights.
More experienced user need to look into specific programs.</p>
<p>Airline programs are more important than hotel programs. There are
always cheap hotels. However there are only so many airlines. So if you
have to focus, focus on airline program over hotel programs.</p>
<p>It is usually a huge time sink to learn too many airline programs.
You just have to be aware of what is possible most of the time. There
are many hacks possible for flying. If you pay cash, <a

<li>I would go for business class if I have accumulated too much points
and I’m traveling internationally. Otherwise I go with economy.</li>
<li>Burn the points at chain hotels like they are not real money.</li>

dining rewards</a> because their miles worth the most and I do located
in Seattle.</li>
<li>If I have decided on a restaurant, I check Groupon<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
or Restaurant.com<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> to see if I can get a
<em>certificates</em>. You must be very careful to understand what
exactly it entails.</li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="2.6" id="time"><span
class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Time</h2>
<p>All the strategies cost time. Try to automate as much as possible.
You should assign value to your time, and decide if certain operations
are worth it. If you value your free time at $50 per hour (after tax),
then it make little sense to spend an hour to obtain $40 discount.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="risk"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Risk</h1>
<p>Note everything you do have certain amount of risk. Generally,
consider every activity and its risk to you. Almost any risk of personal
harm will lead to financial risk.</p>
<p>Here I outline a few.</p>
<ul>
<li>Risky hobbies: The kind of hobbies where personal harm could happen.
Some tamer ones are rock climbing, skiing, etc. A misstep could put you
out of commission for a few weeks. In the worst case, death and become
permanently disabled.</li>
<li>Marriage: On one hand, getting married could help with taxes, but
for both people high income earners, likely they will hit a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_penalty">marriage
penalty</a>.</li>
<li>Divorce: has a huge financial risk to the higher income/low spender
due to common property states and alimony. If there are children
involved, there are also child support.</li>
<li>Children: children is well known to be a black hole that sucks out
all your money because you want the best for them.</li>
<li>House burnt down: likely, if you are young, the house is the largest
asset you own.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not suggesting people should stop doing the things above. People
need to understand the risk before making decisions. Indeed you two
might be in love when getting married. However, a divorce would affect
your future marriage since you have a few year set back and still paying
alimony. These money could be used for your new family and your children
from the previous marriage.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="insurance"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Insurance</h2>
<p>Buy insurances that make sense. On average, insurance company is
making money. So you should only get insurances for very costly items,
the kind that happens will cripple your entire finance or set you back
by a few years.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="use-professionals"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Use professionals</h2>
<p>You can’t do everything yourself, even if it is cheaper. Use a lawyer
when it make sense. For example, dealing with immigration. I have
personally bitten by not getting a lawyer for doing immigration stuff.
Use a tax professional when your tax situation is more complex than what
